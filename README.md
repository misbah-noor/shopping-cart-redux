#  ðŸ›’ Redux Toolkit Shopping Cart

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using React and Redux Toolkit. It fetches product data from the Fake Store API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can add items to their cart, and remove them as needed. The application demonstrates core Redux concepts such as state management, slices, and dispatching actions, making it a great example for beginners learning Redux Toolkit. It also uses React hooks for component state and lifecycle management. This project serves as a practical implementation of integrating external APIs with Redux for dynamic frontend applications.
