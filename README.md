#  ðŸ›’ Redux Toolkit Shopping Cart

Shopee is a simple shopping cart app made by using React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. I built it for learning purposes to practice Redux state management. Products are fetched from fake stote API, and users can add, remove items, update quantity, and view total items and price in the cart. Redux Toolkit helped me handle global state in a clean and organized way.
